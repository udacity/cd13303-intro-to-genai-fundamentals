Of course you will need to review the data to see if the LLM you are using can actually handle this task. In an informal comparison of two commercial LLMs, one was able to handle this task fairly well while the other did not. Note that this was at the time of writing, so things may have changed since then as LLMs are constantly improving.\n",
        "\n",
        "If your LLM cannot handle this task, you can try breaking the problem down into smaller pieces, which is sound advice generally for LLM projects. For instance, you can focus on one student at a time, asking only about a single student in each prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "Will this solution scale? It depends, but likely not. You may have noticed that LLMs currently are not that fast at generating text, and with that additional GPU compute you are likely to spend lots of money. You can consider parallelizing the processing, but that does not reduce cost. Often, we will need to use a combination of AI techniques with more traditional ones to solve this problem. We can also start looking at smaller, more specialized LLMs that are trained on a specific domain, which may be faster and more accurate (more on this in Lesson 4).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of matching a single student with lots of classes, we can first try matching these classes with their departments. In fact, we can use an LLM to generate these lists since our table seems to be missing this information. Then, given a student's major, we can filter out the list of classes that are not in the same department or in related departments. Lastly, we use the LLM to rank the remaining classes based on the student's favorite class.\n",
